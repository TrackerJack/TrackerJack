TrackerJack Tutorial
===================================

What is TrackerJack?

The fast and easy way to export `After Effects <https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html>`_ 3d Camera tracked footage including Cameras, Pointclouds, and Solids into `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`.

Why?

Blender is a fantastic tool with many powerful features for 3D. While it contains a versatile 3d Tracker, it can be very cumbersome and time consuming. Adobe After Effects has a very fast and easy to use 3d Camera Tracker.


How?

TrackerJack has 2 components - an Adobe After Effects Panel to export the data and a Blender add-on to import into your Blender file.
