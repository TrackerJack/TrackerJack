---------------------------------
.. Insert animated gif here

The fast and easy way to export `After Effects <https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html>`_ 3d Camera tracked footage including cameras, nulls, and solids into `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`_ as tracked cameras with background ootage, vector pointclouds, and planes.

---------------------------------
Why?
---------------------------------
Blender is a fantastic tool with many powerful features for 3D. While it contains a versatile 3d Tracker, it can be very cumbersome and time consuming. Adobe After Effects has a very fast and easy to use 3d Camera Tracker.

---------------------------------
How?
---------------------------------
TrackerJack has 2 components - an Adobe After Effects Panel to export the data and a Blender add-on to import into your Blender file.
