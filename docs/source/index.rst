What is TrackerJack?
---------------------------------
.. Insert animated gif here

The fast and easy way to export `After Effects <https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html>`_ 3d Camera tracked footage including cameras, nulls, and solids into `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`_ as tracked cameras with background footage, vector pointclouds, and planes.

---------------------------------
Why?
---------------------------------
Blender is a fantastic tool with many powerful features for 3D. While it contains a versatile 3d Tracker, it can be very cumbersome and time consuming while Adobe After Effects has a very fast and easy to use 3d Camera Tracker. TrackerJack leverages the power and speed of After Effects, so you can spend most of your time in Blender with modeling, animating, and rendering. 

---------------------------------
How?
---------------------------------
TrackerJack has 2 components - an Adobe After Effects Panel to export the tracked data and a Blender add-on to import the data into your Blender file.


---------------------------------
Features
